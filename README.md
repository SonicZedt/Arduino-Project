### Microcontroller:
Arduino-like such as NodeMCU ESP8266 (the one used on this project), Wemos, or anything that could use arduino IDE and ESP8266 as Wi-FI module.

### Input:
RTC DS3231, Ultrasonic, DHT11

### Output:
Servo, LED, Fan, Buzzer. Relay is optional and needed if LED is replace with light bulb and bigger fan.

### Activator:
im using +6V adaptor, + connected to Vin and - Connected to GND on microcontroller. If you're using relay, you need a microcontroler with atleast +5V output on it's pin.

PS: im not using PCB board, i use jumper cable. Please double check the line.
